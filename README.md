In this assignment I'm using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. I'm using a csv dataset. I start by checking the dataset. No null values or duplicates. I predict that the Random Forests Classifier will produce the best score. I split the data into training and testing sets. I then create, fit and compare both Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifer models. The Logistic Regression has the highest and close to accurate score.
